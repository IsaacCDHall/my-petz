      <p>My second favorite place is my house. You don't get to know my first favorite place. Ok fine, it's Epicodus!</p>
      <p>My third favorite place is not even a place! (...it's my <strong>mind</strong>...)</p>
      <p>Place is an illusion, but my fourth favorite place is still a place... it's the park!</p>

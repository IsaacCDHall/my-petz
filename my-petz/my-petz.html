    <h1>Cat Poetry - tiny reflections on my girlfriend's roommate's cats</h1>
    <p>Isa is a beautiful and dangerous cat. She will draw you in with her beauty and then bite you. Like a razor leaf on a tree in the fall.</p>
    <p>Teya is a happy beast. Cookie monster is a good comparison. They both remind us sugar is sweet, but not beautiful.</p>
    <p>Cats are cats. Humans are humans...</p>
    <h2> A cat poem in list form:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There is fur</li>
        <li>There are teeth</li>
        <li>And many a whisker</li>
        <li>May your paws not pause</li>
          <ol>
            <li>when the enemy comes</li>
            <li>when the bird does fly</li>
            <li>when it's time to run</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
